"Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Service, a leading ambulance and EMS provider serving Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, has confirmed that the protected health information of 858,238 patients was exposed or stolen in a cyberattack in May 2023.

Suspicious activity was identified in its IT systems in May 2023 and action was immediately taken to isolate those systems and an investigation was launched to identify the source of the activity. On June 23, 2023, it was confirmed that there had been unauthorized access to its network between May 15 and May 23, 2023, and during that time, an unauthorized actor copied files from its network.

Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Service then conducted a comprehensive and time-intensive review of the affected files to determine the individuals affected and the types of data that had been exposed or stolen. After that process was completed, Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Service worked on obtaining up-to-date contact information to allow notification letters to be sent. Due to the number of individuals involved, that process has taken a considerable amount of time; however, notification letters have now been mailed to the affected individuals on behalf of themselves and relevant affiliated covered entities and subsidiaries."
